# xwire/blueprints

This is a work-in-progress rewrite of https://github.com/tylerlaberge/blueprint-poc using Stencil.js compiled web components for the front end instead of Angular. 

This project is really just an exploration into the merits of Visual Programming Languages, inspired by a prototype game I was working on using Unreal Engine Blueprints. 
Only the frontend is being implemented so far and I likely won't go any further, but it was a fun little side project.
